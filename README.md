# Disruptive Dungeons

Play the role of SP-1N, a robot who’s been captured by a gang of scrappers. Explore their dungeon, destroying enemy robots along the way. As you traverse their dungeon, you may come across “Disruption Fields,” generated fields that mess with your systems, blocking access to certain subsystems like weapons, abilities, jumping, or accelerating.

This game was developed in Godot 3.5 as a part of the UNC collegiate game jam.
